What is voice assistant?
  A voise assistant or intelligent personal assistant is a Software 
mediator that can perform tasts or services for any indivudual 
by voice commands.
  72% of voice-activated speakers owners use the 
devices as part of their daily routine.
  We can use those things:
  Play Music 
  Search Wikipedia 
  Jokes 
  Weather forecast 
  Play YouTube video
  Apps
  News
  
Smarter homes and cities.
This is another small step towards the future, every year we 
create new and interesting technologies for the convenience of 
people 

Many people think that little things like searching for information 
on their own or choosing songs does not take much time, in fact 
it can take from 10 minutes to an hour a day 

It is much more convenient to tell the assistant to do something 
than to look for it yourse
